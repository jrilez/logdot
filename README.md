# Logdot

A super simple minimal Hugo theme.

For the **demo** and **thorough** installation instructions, check out the [guide](http://localhost:1313/posts/how-to-install-hugo-configure-logdot/).
<!-- ## Features -->

## Installation

```shell
# Get latest Hugo version, install it, delete .deb file
# (https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases)
$ wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.123.6/hugo_0.123.6_linux-amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i *.deb; rm -R *.deb

# 'example' is an arbitrary directory, pick whatever you want
$ hugo new site example
$ cd example
$ git clone https://github.com/jrilez/logdot.git themes/logdot

# configure hugo.toml manually or use default site:
$ cp themes/logdot/hugo.toml .
```

## Build your site
```
# if you DON'T want to include drafts, do not add the -D key
$ hugo -D
```

To view the site, start the local development server
```
$ hugo server
Watching for changes in /example/{archetypes,assets,content,data,i18n,layouts,static,themes}
Watching for config changes in /example/hugo.toml, /example/themes/logdot/hugo.toml

Built in 61 ms
Environment: "development"
Serving pages from disk
Running in Fast Render Mode. For full rebuilds on change: hugo server --disableFastRender
Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1)
Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

If you're installing/running hugo somewhere besides your localhost, you'll need an SSH tunnel
in order to access the remote host as local
```bash
ssh -L 1313:localhost:1313 user@ip_address
```
Now you should be able to open a browser to https://localhost:1313 and see your site.

## Configuration

#### Add content
To add content to your site, start by adding a new post
```bash
$ hugo new posts/hello.md
```
This will create a new post in `/example/content/posts/` called `hello.md`. By default, that post
will be a draft.

Sidenote: when you run `hugo -D`, it builds your site and includes drafts. So any posts that you didn't manually set `draft` to `false`, will still show.


[Here's some
markdown syntax references](https://dillinger.io/)

#### About
Hugo will use the theme's About page until you create your own, so copy it to your root file, `/example/content`, and edit it there.
```
$ cp -r themes/logdot/layouts/about layouts
```

And then edit `/example/layouts/about/list.html` with your content.

#### Code highlighting 
To add code highlighting to your post, wrap the codeblock in highlight shortcode, where `bash`
is the language you want highlighted. [These are the supported languages](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-languages) 
for Hugo's built-in use of Chroma.
```
{{< highlight "bash" >}}
#!/bin/bash

echo "hello"
{{< /highlight >}}
```
